# -MACHINE-LEARNING-MODELS
Predicting Depression Using Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest)
The repository contains Python scripts for predicting depression using three different machine learning models:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest Classifier

These models were trained and evaluated using a cleaned Excel dataset with features such as sleep hours, diet, family history, and suicidal thoughts.
